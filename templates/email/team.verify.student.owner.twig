           <p>Hello <strong><a target="_blank" href="{{ main_app_url }}/{{campaign.url}}/team/{{team.url}}">{{team.name}}</a></strong> team owner,</p>
           <p>Thank you again for contributing to the <a target="_blank" href="{{ main_app_url }}/{{campaign.url}}/">{{campaign.name}}</a> campaign. We are having a little trouble validating the student "<strong>{{teamStudent.name}}</strong>" in {{classroom.name}}'s classroom.</p>
           <p>Common reasons why this may happen:</br>
              <ul>
                <li>A nickname or middle name was used instead of their legal first name.</li>
                <li>The student is no longer in that classroom.</li>
                <li>A student with the same name exists in the classroom and we are unable to verify the last name.</li>
              <ul>
           </p>
           <p>Please help us validate your team by responding to this email with any additional information.</p>
